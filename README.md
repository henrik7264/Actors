# Actors
Dear all,

Welcome to an Actors library for C++/Python. You will very soon realize that this is much more that just a library for creating Actors - my hope with this project is to create a framework for creating spectacular software systems.

## Motivation
The creation of this library is highly motivated by poorly crafted software I have seen, maintained and yes also created. It is unbelievable so much bad code that exists - and by bad I mean code . There are thousands and thousands lines of code in a single file and even the purpose of a single function is hard to understand. 


Low coupling
High cohesion
Keep it simple
