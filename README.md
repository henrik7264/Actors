# Actors
Dear all,

Welcome to an Actors library for C++/Python. You will very soon realize that this is much more that just a library for creating Actors - my hope with this project is to create a framework for creating spectacular software systems.

## Motivation
The idea with this library is to create a framework for creating highly performant, scalable and maintainable code. My inspiration for this project originates from the following sources:

* Actors Model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)
* ROS (https://www.ros.org)
* RxROS (https://github.com/rosin-project/rxros)
* RxROS2 (https://github.com/rosin-project/rxros2)
* Reactive Programming (https://reactivex.io)
* Reactive systems (https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)

This Actors library has noting to do with programming robots, although I would encourage everyone working with robots to give it a try. What I am trying here is actually to create a library/framework for creating reactive systems. Yes, I am going all in here, and there is more to come.

## Idea


Low coupling
High cohesion
Keep it simple
