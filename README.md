# Actors
Dear all,

Welcome to an Actors library for C++/Python. You will very soon realize that this is much more that just a library for creating Actors - my hope with this project is to create a framework for creating spectacular software systems.

## Motivation
The creation of this library is highly motivated by poorly crafted software I have seen, maintained and yes also created. It is unbelievable so much bad code that exists. Why is it so hard to put code together that is easy to understand and maintain? 

## 

Low coupling
High cohesion
Keep it simple
