# Actors
Dear all,

Welcome to an Actors library for C++/Python. You will very soon realize that this is much more that just a library for creating Actors - my hope with this project is to create a framework for creating spectacular software systems. LOL - what an idiot you may think - and yes you right this will never be anything but an oid mans dream. So, welcome to my dream!

# The problem
I have worked for many years in the software industry with all kinds of systems ranging from embedded systems, information systems to control and command systems. All systems in the area of several milion lines of code and systems that have to be maintained for more than ten years. I have always struggled with theses systems - always felt I was in the wild west surronded by pistolers that was shuting in all directions to hit the target. The list of problems is long. Here are just a few examples:

* Incomplete and documentation
* Lack of a proper architecture
* reuse of code.

To be continued!!
